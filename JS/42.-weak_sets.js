/*
This is where weak sets and maps come into play. They only hold weak references to their values, allowing garbage collection of the values while they are members of a set or map.

Weak sets are similar to regular sets. The main difference is that their elements may disappear once they are garbage collected.

let firstElement = { order: 1 },
  secondElement = { order: 2 };

let ws = new WeakSet([firstElement, secondElement]);

/*
Other characteristics of weak sets include:

- You donâ€™t have access to the size of the set.
- Weak sets may only store objects.
- Weak sets are not iterable.
The use cases for weak sets are limited. We can use them whenever we deal with objects that can be garbage collected from other sources, and we only want to check the existence of objects in the weak set.

For instance, whenever we traverse a graph, and we would like to detect cycles, we can store the nodes in weak sets during traversal.
