/*
A generator is a special function that returns an iterator. There are some differences between generator functions and regular functions:

- There is an * after the function keyword.
- Generator functions create iterators.
- We use the yield keyword in the created iterator function. By writing yield v, the iterator returns { value: v, done: false } as a value.
- We can also use the return keyword to end the iteration. Similar to iterators, the returned value wonâ€™t be enumerated by a data consumer.
- The yielded result is the next value of the iteration process. Execution of the generator function is stopped at the point of yielding. Once a data consumer asks for another value, execution of the generator function is resumed by executing the statement after the last yield.

function* getLampIterator() {
  yield "red";
  yield "green";
  return "lastValue";
  // implcit: return undefined
}

let lampIterator = getLampIterator();

console.log(lampIterator.next());
//> {value: "red", done: false}

console.log(lampIterator.next());
//> {value: "green", done: false}

console.log(lampIterator.next());
//> {value: "lastValue", done: true}

/*
Important:
If the return value were missing, the function would return {value: undefined, done: true}.

Use generators to define custom iterables to avoid using the well-known symbol Symbol.iterator.
